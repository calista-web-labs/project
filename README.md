### NOtes
While many of these projects were initially built through structured online courses, they have been:

- Refactored with custom file structures and modular code  
- Enhanced with new features or UI/UX improvements  
- Documented and organized to mirror real-world development practices  

I believe that learning by building — then adapting — is key to growth. These projects serve as both a personal archive and a showcase of my evolving skills.
