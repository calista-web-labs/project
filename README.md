## **Notes**

While some projects were initially built through structured learning resources, they have been:

* Refactored with custom file structures and modular code
* Enhanced with additional features or UI improvements
* Organized to reflect practical development workflows

These projects represent applied learning through building and iteration, documenting my technical growth over time.
